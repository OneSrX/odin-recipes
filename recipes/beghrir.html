    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Moroccan pancakes are served with honey-butter sauce. Best during Ramadan
      for breaking the fast or pre-dawn, but certainly great anytime.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250g of fine semolina flour</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons plain flour (40g)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 heaped teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>500ml warm water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender insert the semolina, flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the
        warm water and blend until there are no lumps and the batter is smooth.
        <em
          >If you don't have a blender place all the ingredients in a large bowl
          and use an electric whisk instead of a blender</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the baking powder and blend again for a few seconds. Leave the
        batter for 30 minutes to allow the yeast to proof and blend again for a
        few seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a non-stick pan and place it over medium high heat. Wait for the
        pan to be very hot to start baking the pancakes, otherwise you won't get
        many holes on your pancakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a small amount of batter (as you would for any pancake) and leave
        the pancake until it dries out. As soon as you place the batter on the
        pan, the batter should start bubbling and drying out. Once the baghrir
        is no longer wet (it takes about a minute), it will mean that it is
        cooked. Baghrir are cooked only on one side. Never flip them while
        baking them as you will loose the holes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat until you've used all the batter.
        <strong
          >Don't pile up your Moroccan pancakes while they are still hot</strong
        >, as they will stick to each other. If you want to pile them when they
        are hot, separate them with a tissue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve hot and top your baghrirs with anything yummy, pretty much like
        with any other pancake!
