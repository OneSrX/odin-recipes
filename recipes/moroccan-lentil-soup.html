    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This delicious lentil soup is fun and easy to make. My family and I have
      been trying to eat healthy, so I started adding veggies to all my soups.
      You can modify it in many ways — add your favorite cooking oil, as well as
      any greens you like!
    </p>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots,
          onion, kosher salt, parsley, black pepper, ginger, tarragon, and
          cumin; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 5 to 7
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in lentils and tomatoes. Pour vegetable broth over all vegetables
          and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low,
          cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in spinach and zucchini; simmer until zucchini is tender, about 7
          minutes. Remove from the heat and season to taste with salt. Drizzle 1
          teaspoon olive oil over the soup before serving.
